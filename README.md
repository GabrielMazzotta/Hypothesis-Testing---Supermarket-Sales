# Hypothesis Testing on Supermarket Sales

## Introduction

This project is dedicated to uncovering valuable business insights through the lens of __statistical tests__ applied to supermarket sales data. With a specific focus on __hypothesis testing__, we aim to delve into the underlying patterns and relationships within the dataset.

Emphasizing a rigorous analytical approach, the project sets a margin of error at 5%, ensuring the precision of our statistical inferences. Through this exploration, we seek to not only understand the dynamics of supermarket sales but also contribute actionable findings to inform strategic business decisions.



## Statistical Tests and Concepts
- 2 sample non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney U test)
- Bootstrap estimates
- Normality Test
- ANOVA
- Chi-square Independence Test
- 2 Sample Proportion Test

## Business insights
* Total purchasing by gender
* Rating by branch
* Association between costumer type and product line
* Customer type by gender

 
## Language/Libraries
* Python / Jupyter notebooks
* Scipy.stats
* Pingouin
* Statsmodels.stats
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Conclusions 
This project illustrated how exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical hypothesis testing can address specific business requirements.
 
The insights gained from these analyses pave the way for further investigation and potential development of machine learning algorithms tailored to meet the specific needs of the business.  

The results obtained here provide a foundation for informed decision-making and continuous improvement in line with business objectives.
